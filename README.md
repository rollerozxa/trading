# Trading
Allows players to trade items with each other via the use of the /trade and /accepttrade commands.

Forked from GunshipPenguin's original mod.

## Usage
Players must have the "trade" privilege in order to request trades. This privilege is given to players by default, if a player newly joins after this mod is enabled.

- To request a trade use `/trade <player_name>`
- To accept a trade offer from a specific player, use `/accepttrade <player_name>`
